CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniformtechnology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browserDNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at thistime.<br><br>‍<strong>Global Privacy Control: </strong>We recognize and honor Global Privacy Control(GPC) signals. If you use a browser or extension that supports GPC, we will treat this as a valid request to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information for targeted advertising purposes under applicable state privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).When we detect a GPC signal from your browser, we will automatically apply your opt-out preference without requiring you to take any additional action.
